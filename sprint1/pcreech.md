## Sprint 1 Reflection
# What I planned to do
* Create a Fill Tool Button for the category of Create Buttons (6)
* Create an option which users can resize the canvas for the category of Menu Buttons (12)
# What I didn't do
* I didn't accomplish both tasks
# Problems I encountered
* Making enough disk space for downloading the Qt software
* Unable to download a kit for macOS
# What I accomplished
* I didn't accomplish anything because I had a lot of technical diffulties with downloading Qt software. But today, I have finally fixed the problem.
