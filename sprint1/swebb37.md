# Skyla Webb Sprint 1 Reflection

## What you planned to do
* Issues {#2},{#3}, and {#7}
* Planned to do the layout, make buttons, and add a color wheel
* Get project set up

## What you did not do
* Did not get zoom in / out and undo / redo working
* Did not get second row of menus

## What problems you encountered
* Setting up and learning how to use Qt.
* Getting functions to work (zoom in, zoom out, redo, undo).
* Getting second row on menus

## What you accomplished
* Got project set up and helped with everyone getting it working
* I added menu buttons, but did not complete their functionality.
* I woked on main.cpp, as well as misc_paint.cpp, scribblearea.cpp and their respective .h files (inside paint app tut folder,
  the paint app one is not the real one)
* Also worked a little on misc_paint.ui, but that one isn't that much anyway

# NOTE Forgot to link issues, so here they are
## Issues #2, commit e1c0630
