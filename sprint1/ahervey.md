### What you planned to do
- I planned to help with the zoom function and get my undo/redo buttons working (which were specifically assigned to me)

### What you did not do
- Get Zoom function working
- Get redo/undo working

### What problems you encountered
- I tried following the official Qt tutorial (for redo/undo) but struggled because it was out of date and was just not working. Personally, I don't have enough knowledge to do it without help so my
attempts led me to delete most of what I had and comment the variables I planned to use to reviist them at a later date. The zoom function wasn't a pressing issue so we decided not to do it at this time.

### What you accomplished
- Worked on issue 16/10/11
- I edited the misc_paint.h/cpp as well as minor changes to the scribble.cpp 
- I did not accomplism my specific task(s) but did however, help come up with the intial buttons and deciding which menu headers needed to be created (though I did not commit, was done by another member)
- Also helped create the nitial issues and breaking up the working into smaller parts when initially starting the project
