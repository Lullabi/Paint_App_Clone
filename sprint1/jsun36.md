### What I planned to do
- Create a canvas area for people to doodle this
- Able to resize the canvas by giving it two values(length/height)
- Working on the Import/Export functionality

### What I did not do
- I'm not able to resize the canvas

### What problems I encountered
- As I mention above, I did not get the resizing functionality to work due to unfamiliarity of the platform's library set. I will go over the Qt6 library during to spring break, and hopefully to get an idea of how to resize the canvas.  

### What I accomplished
- I created the button for resizing the canvas
- I got some of the Canvas's functionality to work
