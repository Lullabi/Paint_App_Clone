## What I planned to do for Sprint 3:
- I originally planned to touch up on my undo/redo buttons that I had finished in Sprint 2. They were a bit buggy and lacked when using the erase canvas tool,
- so I believe I finally fixed that. I also worked on my new issues which was trying to add some sort of brush property and erase tool

## What I did not do:
- I did not manage to figure out how to add text to the canvas. I could not find a guide on how to do so and lacked the proper knowledge to do so myself, at least for it to be be done for Sprint 3

## Problems that I encountered during production:
- Well it was hard to figure out what exactly to do for brush properties. That's lofty. In additon, the vectors/stacks did not properly identify when it was empty
- so I had some trouble trying to add conditionals to my functions. I also did not know how to be able connect paramaterized functions to buttons.

## What I've accomplished in Sprint 1:
- Tweaked Undo/Redo (Issue #10/11)
- Understanding setAlphaF and other QColor functions
- Creating butttons and connecting them to the functions 
- Created Opacity editing buttons and an eraser (Issue 32/21)
