# Sprint 2

## What I planned to do
* Get zoom in / out working
* Get blending tools working
* Get select tool working

## What I did not do
* Get zoom in / out working
* Get select tool working completely
* Get blending modes working

## What problems I encountered
* Figuring out how to go about doing the select tool
* Working on issues assigned to me as opposed to other people's issues
* Figuring out zoom in / out feature is still a struggle

## What I accomplished
* Created a shape tool that creates a square or a rectangle
* Added base for select tool
* Added a new brush type (marker)
* Added functionality for multiple brush types to be selected

## Issues I worked on
* Issue #21
* Issue #22
* Issue #24 (didn't commit to this one though, as I committed under issue 22)

## Files I worked on
* PaintApp/paint_app_tut/misc_paint.h
* PaintApp/paint_app_tut/misc_paint.cpp
* PaintApp/paint_app_tut/scribblearea.h
