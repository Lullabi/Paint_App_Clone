# Sprint 3 - Chaz Creech
Name: Chaz Creech
GitHub ID: chazthecoder
Group Name: PaintApp
## What I planned to do
* Modify MouseEvent functions for fill and line issue {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)} {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
* Create separate functions to change the mode of line and fill using boolean variables {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)} {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
* Create a button for line and fill tool {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)} {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
## What I did not do
* I haven't yet modified the layout inside the grid with all of the tools to add a fill tool button {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)}
* In general, I still haven't finished fill and line tool issue as I hoped to finish by the time this sprint is due {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)} {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
* I haven't started work on the shape tool {[issue #22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/22#issue-1188380090)}
## What problems I encountered
* When I'm using the line tool, the program crashes when the mouseMoveEvent is called. {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
* I'm struggling to figure out how to fill paint in certain areas surrounded by a border of paint. {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)}
## What I accomplished
* I programmed it to where it changes the mode on which line tool is the user is currently using from default tool to line tool and from line tool to default tool {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}. Also, I created a button for the line tool {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}.
