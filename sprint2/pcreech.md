Name: Chaz Creech
GitHub ID: chazthecoder
Group Name: PaintApp
## What I planned to do
* Center the image (canvas) on the window for the resize option {[issue #12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/12#issue-1147273568)}
* Modify resizeEvent to fix the manual resizing window which causes the canvas to resize {[issue #12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/12#issue-1147273568)}
* Create an input function to resize the canvas {[issue #12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/12#issue-1147273568)}
* Start work on the other issues {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)} {[issue #22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/22#issue-1188380090)} {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
## What I did not do
* Center the image (canvas) on the window, but I talked with my group about that and they decided that the Menu Button is good enough to close {[issue #12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/12#issue-1147273568)}
* Started work on the other issues {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)} {[issue #22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/22#issue-1188380090)} {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
## What problems I encountered
* I researched a lot about resizing the image (canvas) on the window and when I wrote the code, there were some exit calls in the program. {[issue #12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/12#issue-1147273568)}
## What I accomplished
* I finished creating the menu button: Resize Canvas. I wrote my own resizeEvent just to size the image (canvas) when the window and image is first created from the beginning. This also fizes the issue with the image automatically resizing as the window is manually resizing. Also, it has an input function that asks the user for the height and width of the canvas. {[issue #12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/12#issue-1147273568)}
## Issues I worked on
* Menu Button: Resize Canvas to desired pixel size {[issue #12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/12#issue-1147273568)}
