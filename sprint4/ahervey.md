# PaintApp - ahervey

## What I planned to do for Sprint 4:
- I originally planned to create a text bos tool, but unfortunately was unable to figure out how to do so, and seeing as this was the home strecth, I could not think of anything
- that was simple enough to do to add depth to the program without being difficult. So I added some bug fixes that I hoped resolved all the problems I had from the previous sprint


## What I did not do:
- I did not do the text box too

## Problems that I encountered during production:
- Well it was hard to figure out what exactly to do for the last sprint. Not to mention undo and redo are especialy tricky with me being an ovice to QT. As well as navigating
- the code I did not write, so I couldn't debug across all avenues as I didn't understand some of the features and how to verify if they were working properly (namely opacity changes)

## What I've accomplished in Sprint 4:
- Tweaked Undo/Redo (Issue #10/11)
- Created Windows executable (Issue #43)
- Add changes to opacity tool for the sake of simplicity/Changed the buffer value (Issue #21)
- Tweaked Eraser tool (Issue #32)
- Added some things to the readme as a way of getting started using the program (Issue #39)
