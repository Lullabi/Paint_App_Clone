In Demo/
- Created executable directory and deployed the program

In README.md
- To begin drawing in PaintApp, first select "New File" in the header of PaintApp and select the width and height of your canvas 
(limits as of now are 1000 for both). Altermatively you can open whatever image you have on your computer and start drawing however you like. 
The porgram also gives you the option to select the default canvas color so you can get more creative with what you're creating.

- Adding shapes to the canvas
- Decreasing/Increasing the opacity of the brush
- Different types of brushes
- Eraser tool

- There isn't a whole lot of features that come with the application but it's a solid program that follows a blueprint similar to MS Paint well. 
For the most part, the program is self explanatory. The only thing that's unique to our program is the C1/C2 which allows you to have different colors 
for the pen that you can use by drawing using left or right click.

In paint_app_tut/misc_paint.h
- double buffer = .20;

In paint_app_tut/scribblearea.cpp
- if (test == 0 || test == 1 || (ustack.last() == ustack.front() && test == 2)){
        return;
    }
    
In paint_app_tut/misc_paint.cpp
- void Misc_Paint::setErase() {
    scribbleArea->setPenColor(canvasColor);
}
- increaseOpacity->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+Shift+="));
- decreaseOpacity->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+-"));
