# Sprint 3 - Chaz Creech
Name: Chaz Creech
GitHub ID: chazthecoder
Group Name: PaintApp
## What I planned to do
* Finish all of my issues for sprint4 {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)} {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)} {[issue #22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/22#issue-1188380090)}
* Create a function that draws a shape based on user input {[issue #22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/22#issue-1188380090)}
* Finish work and fixing errors on the line tool {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
* Create a function that fills portions of the canvas with paint {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)}
## What I did not do
* I haven't created a functioning fill tool in time {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)}
## What problems I encountered
* When the user draws a shape and a line, the program exits with some sort of segmentation fault but I managed to fix the problem. {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)} {[issue #22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/22#issue-1188380090)}
* I wasn't able to create a function that can fill a portion on the canvas with paint because I created a recursive function which made the whole program very slow when the user uses the tool. {[issue #6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/6#issue-1147271938)}
## What I accomplished
* I created a working line and shape tool. The user can draw any shape on the canvas which the app provides about 13 shapes for the user to decide. {[issue #22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/22#issue-1188380090)} Also, the user can draw as many lines as the user likes. {[issue #27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/PaintApp/issues/27#issue-1188443558)}
